Homework #1 

The main objective of this assignment was to implement selection. 
I did this following with the way it was done in the square and object class. 
That means I used the back buffer to draw shapes with different colors in order
compare these colors to all objects when pixel color was read in the mouse call back.
I believe I did pretty well with this homework , I planned to put textrues over the 
shapes and somehow make a health bar but time wouldnt allow.Also since I am just now
finishing it up my code is a jumbled mess including 4 classes in one file.Sorry about that, 
but if it is any concelation I enjoyed this homework enough to want to improve upon this game.
So eventually those classes will have seprate files.
